# Interactive 3

3 interactive pages that can be used to explore the data. Each page should revolve around a specific question you have for your dataset. Each page should have sufficient interactivity (e.g., Shiny widgets + 1 or more reactive charts) for exploring the question of interest. If you would prefer to make fewer pages with more complexity, check with your TA/professor.
