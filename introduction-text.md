# Introduction to the Human Freedom Index
This is the analysis of the Human Freedom Index from the Cato Institute’s research from 2008 to 2019.

[Kaggle - The Human Freedom Index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsutters/the-human-freedom-index?select=hfi_cc_2021.csv)

Our project is centralized around observation of the world’s countries and what insights we can take from the Human Freedom Index. With this data, we are able to understand how oppressive the governments of certain nations are and how expressive the citizens are allowed to be.

Some of the limitations of the dataset on Kaggle are that specific indicators, such as daughters inheritance, are missing significant data. Furthermore, there is a category named Rule of Law which includes mostly crime statistics. To try to maintain the integrity of the dataset, we have removed these specific indicators.

## Our 3 research questions

Over the decade since data has been collected, how have the world’s countries’ scores shifted and does this tell us anything about shifts in certain regions of the world?

How might the ranking of countries show the progress of the lowest and highest rated countries and does this reflect a greater shift in the world’s human freedom?

What does the freedom of expression ranking say about the countries of the world and how do these results demonstrate the culture of the region?
